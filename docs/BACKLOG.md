# Feature Backlog (Post-MVP)

These features are intentionally **DEFERRED**. Do NOT implement them during the current phase unless explicitly requested.

## Priority 1 (Next after MVP)
- [ ] Multi-underlying analysis (test scenario across all S&P 500 stocks)
- [ ] Weekly and intraday timeframe support
- [ ] Additional chart indicators added dynamically in chart view
- [ ] Scenario duplication / cloning
- [ ] Condition drag-and-drop reordering

## Priority 2 (Future)
- [ ] Grouped/nested conditions: `(A AND B) OR (C AND D)` with visual grouping
- [ ] Custom indicator formulas (user-defined)
- [ ] Monte Carlo simulation overlay
- [ ] Comparison of two scenarios side-by-side
- [ ] Portfolio-level analysis (multiple underlyings with correlation)
- [ ] Automated report generation (PDF)
- [ ] Dark/Light theme toggle (dark is default, light is bonus)
- [ ] Window state persistence (remember size/position)
- [ ] Auto-update mechanism for the desktop app
- [ ] Watchlist / favorites for tickers

## Priority 3 (Maybe Later)
- [ ] Cloud sync for scenarios
- [ ] Sharing scenarios as JSON import/export
- [ ] Real-time data integration
- [ ] Options-specific analysis (Greeks, IV, etc.)
- [ ] Machine learning-based pattern recognition
